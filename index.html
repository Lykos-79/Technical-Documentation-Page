                <p>The Toyota 86 and the Subaru BRZ are 2+2 sports cars jointly developed by Toyota and Subaru,
                    manufactured at Subaru's Gunma assembly plant.</p>
                <p>The 2+2 fastback coupé has a naturally-aspirated boxer engine, front-engined, rear-wheel-drive
                    configuration, 53/47 front/rear weight balance and low centre of gravity; it was inspired by
                    Toyota's earlier AE86, a small, light, front-engine/rear-drive Corolla variant widely popular for
                    Showroom Stock, Group A, Group N, Rally, Club and drift racing</p>
                <p>For the first-generation model, Toyota marketed the sports car as the 86 in Asia, Australia, North
                    America (from August 2016), South Africa, and South America;as the Toyota GT86 in Europe; as the
                    86 and GT86 in New Zealand; as the Toyota FT86 in Brunei, Nicaragua and Jamaica and as the Scion
                    FR-S (2012–2016) in the United States and Canada.</p>
                <p>The second-generation model is marketed by Toyota as the GR86 as part of the Gazoo Racing family.</p>

            <article>
                <p>Initial layout and design elements for the 86 were presented by Toyota using its "FT" (Future Toyota)
                    concept car nomenclature. The first was the Toyota FT-HS, which was presented at the North American
                    International Auto Show in 2007. It had a front engine, rear-wheel drive layout and 2+2 seating and
                    was powered by a V6 engine with hybrid electric assistance. In 2008, Toyota bought 16.5% of Fuji
                    Heavy Industries, which includes the Subaru automotive brand.Toyota, led by project leader Tetsuya
                    Tada,then invited Subaru to partner in the project, by co-developing the new D-4S boxer engine.The
                    offer, which conflicted with Subaru's reputation for high performance all-wheel drive (AWD) cars,
                    was rejected. The project came to a six-month halt before Toyota invited journalists and Subaru
                    engineers to test a developmental prototype. Following the test, Subaru agreed to become further
                    involved in development.</p>
                <p>The collaboration produced a concept car, the FT-86 Concept, which debuted at the Tokyo Motor Show in
                    October 2009. Smaller than the FT-HS, the design of the FT-86 was further refined by Toyota's ED2
                    design studio while the hybrid V6 powerplant was replaced by the new D-4S boxer. Subaru provided the
                    chassis, modifying it from their Impreza. The custom red paint was based on the backside of a
                    Japanese macaque.Classic Toyota sports cars such as the AE86, Celica and Supra were cited as
                    inspirations for the concept.</p>
                <p>At the 2010 Tokyo Motor Show, Toyota launched its G Sports line of aftermarket accessories, along
                    with the FT-86 G Sports concept car. It featured G Sports carbon fibre panels, a vented bonnet, rear
                    wing, 19 in (48 cm) wheels, Recaro race seats, and an interior rollcage.The D-4S engine also added a
                    turbocharger.</p>
                <p>In 2011, Toyota and Subaru unveiled five near-production concept cars to show their progress with the
                    project. The first, known as the FT-86 II Concept, was unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show in March
                    2011. ED2 refined the design of the initial FT-86, by developing new front and rear fascias, and
                    marginally increasing the dimensions of the concept.At the same show, Subaru unveiled a transparent
                    silhouette of the car showing the new D-4S boxer engine and displayed the "Boxer Sports Car
                    Architecture".</p>
                <p>Scion followed in April 2011 at the New York International Auto Show with the FR-S Sports Coupé
                    Concept, co-developed with aftermarket tuner Five Axis.Another semi-transparent Subaru concept,
                    known as the BRZ Prologue, was shown at the Frankfurt Motor Show that September,followed in November
                    at the Los Angeles Auto Show by the BRZ Concept STi, the first full mock-up of Subaru's version of
                    the 86 with input from Subaru Tecnica International (STI).</p>

                        7,000 orders were placed for the Toyota 86 in the first month of production,while Subaru took in
                        3,500 orders.</p>
                    <p>In the United States, Scion were allocated 10,000 units of the 2013 model year (MY13)
                        production,while Subaru was limited to only 6,000 units.</p>

                    <article>
                        <p>The 86's low-weight design uses an aluminium hood, a fixed roof, and a trunk as opposed to a
                            hatchback.To improve driving dynamics, the boxer engine is mounted low in a front engine /
                            rear drive layout, yielding a weight distribution of 53% in front and 47% in the rear and a
                            low centre of mass height.</p>
                        <p>The 86's engine, known by the Toyota code 4U-GSE and Subaru code FA20, is a naturally
                            aspirated engine that uses Subaru's flat-four engine design, with the addition of Toyota's
                            D-4S injection system, which uses Gasoline direct injection (GDI). With its front-engine,
                            rear-wheel-drive layout, its engine runs on 98 RON (premium unleaded) fuel and features a
                            compression ratio of 12.5:1 with a bore and stroke of 86 mm (3.39 in) for a total
                            displacement of 2.0 L; 121.9 cu in (1,998 cc) that results in 200 PS (197 bhp; 147 kW) at
                            7,000 rpm and 151 lb⋅ft (205 N⋅m) of torque at 6,400 rpm.</p>
                        <p>The 86, BRZ and FR-S are offered with two 6-speed transmissions: an in-house developed Toyota
                            TL70 manual gearbox (based on Aisin AI's AZ6) and an Aisin-Warner A960E automatic
                            transmission, which is modified from that used on the Lexus IS 250. The latter uses a
                            traditional wet torque converter design, but its software has been engineered to mimic the
                            response of a dual-clutch transmission. The automatic transmission uses three different
                            modes: Sport, Snow, and Normal. A torsen style limited slip differential is standard on most
                            models.</p>
                        <p>The vehicles are offered with 16" steel and alloy wheels fitted with Yokohama dB Decibel E70
                            tyres in 205/55 size or 17" alloy wheels fitted with Michelin Primacy HP tyres in 215/45
                            size, depending on sales market. The limited editions Toyota Racing Development (TRD) GT86
                            models are instead offered with 18" forged aluminium wheels, which are fitted with either
                            Yokohama Advan Sport tyres or Michelin Pilot Sport 3 tyres in 225/40 size, also depending on
                            market. The braking systems vary between models and countries:</p>

                        <p>According to the 86's designers, "The goal was to create an authentic rear-wheel drive sports
                            car with compelling style, exceptionally balanced performance and handling, flexible utility
                            and surprising MPG."[7] When asked about the TRD version of the car, the lead engineer Mr.
                            Tada said "There is definitely going to be a more TRD oriented variant down the line.
                            However any of the parts that would be standard on the TRD model will fit on your current
                            Toyota 86 so there is no need to wait."</p>
                        <p>The design of the GT86 was inspired by the Toyota 2000GT, as part of the concept of 'Neo
                            Functionalism' (the idea that the cars driving quality and appearance were part of its
                            functionality). 2000GT references were especially apparent in the side profile, windows and
                            dashboard of the car.</p>
                        <p>The 86 "boxer" side badge appears on all Toyota and Scion versions of the car, but not the
                            Subaru BRZ. Aside from badging, the main differences between the 86/GT86 and the BRZ are the
                            front grilles and bumper bars.</p>
                        <p>The car included numerous references to the number 86:</p>

                            <li>the engine bore and stroke is 86mm x 86mm</li>

                <header>Toyota 86, GT86 and FT86</header>
                <article>
                    <p>The Toyota 86 is available in Japan from Toyota's Netz Store and Corolla Store line of
                        dealerships; the 1980s Corolla Levin and Sprinter Trueno were sold at the same networks. Four
                        trim levels are offered, with the RC model being the base aimed at people wishing to modify or
                        race their vehicles.[51][52] This model is available with only a 6-speed manual transmission and
                        comes with unpainted bumpers and mirrors, 16 inch steel wheels, simpler interior trim
                        components, analogue speedometer and no stereo or air conditioning. Outside Japan, the RC model
                        is only available in New Zealand. The G model adds all the interior components missing from the
                        RC, plus a fully painted exterior and 16 inch alloy wheels and the availability of an automatic
                        transmission. The GT86 model adds high intensity discharge headlights with LED daytime running
                        lights, fog lamps, automatic climate control, keyless start with engine start button, 17 inch
                        alloy wheels, chrome exhaust tips, white tachometer face with analogue and digital speedometer,
                        silver accents on the centre dash and steering wheel, aluminium pedals. The top-of-the-range GT
                        Limited adds leather and Alcantara seating and a rear spoiler.</p>
                    <p>In Europe, GT86 models are generally the same as the Japanese 86 GT with a red/black
                        leather/Alcantara interior with red stitching. In the United Kingdom, the Japanese G model is
                        sold as the GT86 Primo[47] and the car has also been available as a limited edition Toyota
                        Racing Development "TRD GT86", which features: 18 inch forged aluminium wheels with Yokohama
                        Advan Sport tyres; full bodykit with front and side skirts, rear spoiler and new diffuser;
                        quad-exhaust system; TRD-branded detailing on the filler cap, radiator cap and gear knob. In New
                        Zealand, the TRD 86 is sold with the above features except for Michelin Pilot Sport 3 tyres
                        instead plus upgraded TRD braking system. Options not available to all markets include a Bose
                        sound system upgrade.</p>
                    <p>In Australia, the GT is the equivalent of the Japanese G model but with only an all black
                        interior trim and standard radio head unit, whereas the top-of-the-range GTS model is the
                        equivalent of the Japanese GT Limited except for an all black leather/Alcantara and red-stitch
                        interior trim only and touchscreen multimedia head unit. Upon Australian launch in June 2012,
                        all models for Australia featured a full-size spare wheel, the GTS lacked a rear spoiler, and a
                        limited slip differential or LSD was standard on all models except automatic GT's.[46] The
                        full-size spare wheel was phased out after the first shipments to Australia, replaced with a
                        repair kit. This model also benefited from a remapping of its Electronic Control Unit (ECU) to
                        address initial reports of rough idling and stalling.[53] The range of models and main options
                        had the following retail prices: GT manual A$29,990; GT automatic A$32,490; GTS manual A$35,490;
                        GTS automatic A$37,990; metallic paint A$425 for all models; "Aero pack" bodykit A$3,000 for GTS
                        only.</p>
                    <p>As of the August 2013 production update (which carried the formal year designation MY14), the
                        automatic GT also gained LSD as standard (but with a price increase of A$300; manual price
                        unchanged in Australia) and the GTS gained the same rear spoiler fitted to the Japanese GTS
                        Limited and the Subaru BRZ (with a price increase of A$500 for both the manual and automatic
                        model in Australia).[54] Other distinguishing features on the MY14 models include the removal of
                        the lettered "TOYOTA" badge from the rear bonnet of the GTS and optional availability of rear
                        parking sonar sensors on GT and GTS.</p>
                    <p>In July 2014, an updated version of the Australian Toyota 86 range was launched with year
                        designation MY15. The key highlights include: revised suspension settings; "shark-fin" roof
                        antenna; GTS instrument cluster on GT; carbon-fibre look dash insert and reverse-view camera on
                        GTS; new white and silver exterior paints. The price of the GT remained unchanged while the GTS
                        was the subject of a price increase of A$500 and A$800 for the manual and automatic version,
                        respectively.</p>
                    <p>In late 2014, as part of its MY15 range, Toyota offered in the UK two new models: the GT86 Aero,
                        featuring a full bodykit and 18 inch OZ Ultraleggera alloy wheels in anthracite grey finish; and
                        the GT86 "Giallo" (meaning yellow in Italian), limited to only 86 units.[56] Similar to the
                        latter, Toyota also offered in Italy a total of 50 "Limited Edition" models.[57] Externally, the
                        key distinguishing feature of these limited editions is the new Sunrise Yellow metallic paint
                        and black side stripes (bonnet, roof and bonnet stripes are available in the UK at no extra cost
                        and standard in Italy). The interior is distinguished by a limited edition badge and heated
                        quilt leather seats with yellow 86 logo. The retail price of the Limited Edition in Italy is
                        €28,500, which translates to €1,700 more than the standard base model.</p>
                    <p>At the same time in Japan, Toyota released the 14R-60 model limited to 100 units, inspired by the
                        GT86 TRD Griffon Project of 2013. Its engine power remains the same as the standard models
                        despite featuring various drivetrain changes such as twin central exhausts, a TRD mechanical
                        LSD, a short-shifter, and revised gearing for the six-speed manual transmission. Other changes
                        include extra body reinforcement, a variable-height coil-over spring suspension setup and more
                        rigid suspension bushings. A TRD bodykit with carbon fibre components is complemented by 18 inch
                        magnesium wheels and, overall, 14R-60 model results lighter than the base model. Inside there
                        are race-style bucket seats with four-point belts, an Alcantara-clad steering wheel, carbon
                        fibre dashboard trim and yellow piping and highlights. Price-wise, this Japan-only model is
                        listed for ¥6,300,000, which is significantly higher than the ¥2,100,000 for the base RC model
                        or ¥3,100,000 for the top-of-the-range GT Limited.</p>
                    <p>In 2015, the 86xstyle Cb was officially launched after its presentations at the 2013 and 2014
                        Tokyo Auto Salon. It is characterised by a drastically different front end design with revised
                        lights and bumper bar but standard bonnet. Available in 6-speed manual or automatic
                        transmission, it has revised interior trimmings including a red Cb logo embroidered leather
                        steering wheel, white (instead of red) backlit instruments and a dark woodgrain-style panel
                        across the dashboard. The most peculiar features are the replacement of the front side gills
                        with a set of LED-illuminated fins and optional contrasting colour for the car's upper body
                        section. Another option is different alloy wheels than those fitted as standard on the GT86. On
                        sale from April, this Japan-only model is listed for ¥4,180,000, which is a ¥1,280,000 premium
                        over the regular 86 GT on which this variant is based.</p>
                    <p>To celebrate Australia's 86 2016 Pro-Am racing series,[61][62][63] the following November Toyota
                        launched 450 "Blackline" units (250 of which with manual transmission). Based on the standard
                        GTS model, this limited edition carries a A$2,000 premium because of its cosmetic upgrade with
                        TRD parts and special livery.</p>
                    <p>In Indonesia, the 86 was launched in 2012.[65] The facelifted version was launched in August
                        2016.[66] Toyota Indonesia sells the 86 in the TRD package with only an automatic transmission
                        and the non-TRD package with both manual and automatic transmission.</p>
                    <p>In 2018, Toyota sold a special edition 86 called Apollo Blue to celebrate that the 86 had passed
                        20,000 units sold in Australia. It features a unique Apollo Blue body colour, black rear spoiler
                        and mirror caps, and is only available with the optional Dynamic Performance Package.[68] It was
                        only sold in Australia and United Kingdom[citation needed] with both manual and automatic
                        transmission options.</p>
                    <p>Peculiarly, in Jamaica and Nicaragua, the 86 is marketed and sold using one of its pre-launch
                        concept car badges, the "FT-86".</p>
                    <p>Although BRZ production ended in July 2020, 86 production was to continue at least until the
                        third quarter of 2020.</p>

                <header>Subaru BRZ</header>
                <article>
                    <p>The BRZ's name comes from three elements: Boxer engine, rear-wheel drive, and Z standing for
                        Zenith.[72][73] The Subaru BRZ differs from the 86's design in the front fascia, with a
                        different grille and headlight assembly, as well as a different front fender vent. The BRZ's
                        grill is hexagonal in shape, compared to the Toyota's trapezoid. The BRZ features a wraparound
                        of LED parking lights in the headlight assembly, while daytime running lights are integrated
                        into the bumper. The suspension setup of the Subaru is different from the Toyota.[74] Like the
                        Japanese Toyota 86, Subaru offers an RA base model lacking most interior comforts and using 16
                        inch steel wheels, with the only difference from the 86 RC being that the BRZ RA's bumpers are
                        painted the same colour as the body. Two main trim levels are offered: R trim, known as Premium
                        in North America, and S trim, known as Limited in North America. The most notable differences
                        between the trims being the S trim (Limited) received leather seats with Alcantara inserts that
                        were heated rather than the cloth seats in the R trim (Premium). In Europe and Australia BRZs
                        offer a Toyota stereo unit, while Japanese and North American vehicles use a Subaru unit.
                        Australian BRZs were originally available for sale only online.</p>
                    <p>In 2013, Subaru unveiled a BRZ tS model for the Japanese market, tuned by STI. The tS model
                        features an improved suspension setup, 18 inch silver BBS wheels, STI bodykit and front spoiler,
                        a larger drive shaft, and Brembo brakes, along with interior changes including a new steering
                        wheel, front seat, gauges, and Alcantara accents.[75] A further tS GT Package includes Recaro
                        seats, black BBS wheels, and an adjustable carbon fibre rear wing. The tS is limited to 500
                        units in total, with a maximum of 250 of them being the GT package.[76] In 2015, a similar
                        release of 300 units was sold again only in Japan.</p>
                    <p>In 2014, as part of running changes consistent with those of the MY15 Toyota 86 GTS, the Subaru
                        BRZ also featured a new key fob and two new colours, including 'WR Blue Pearl' metallic
                        finish.[78] In addition, Subaru also launched special editions both for the United States and
                        Australia markets. For the former, one thousand BRZ Series. Blue editions were marketed at
                        additional cost, half painted in Blue Pearl and the other half in Crystal Pearl White. This
                        model featured STI body kit parts, 17-inch STI black alloy wheels and red brake calipers. For
                        Australia, Subaru launched a similar variant known as the Special Edition, also at additional
                        cost. It featured stripes across the bonnet, boot and roof; 17-inch STI black alloy wheels; STI
                        boot spoiler plus front, side and rear-side under spoilers; a rear diffuser and a push-button
                        starter switch. It was available in every existing BRZ paint hue.</p>

                        accessories;[83] hence, the FR-S was offered in a single standard trim, with exterior colours
                        and the choice of transmission typically being the only factory options. However, Scion offered

                    <p>Built by Los Angeles metal shop, Cartel Customs, and displayed at the 2014 SEMA Show, the Scion
                        FR-S T1 is the first targa top version of any 86-based model. Apart from the Porsche 911-style

                    <p><b>Subaru STI Performance Concept (2015)</b></p>
                    <p>Subaru unveiled the BRZ-based STI Performance Concept at the 2015 New York Auto Show.[126] It
                        stated that this concept car does not preview a production model but rather a visualization of
                        the future application of the STI program to the BRZ. The concept car uses the same turbocharged
                        2.0-litre engine employed in the BRZ GT300 race car, producing an estimated 220 kW (300 bhp) and
                        330 lb⋅ft (447 N⋅m). Even so, Subaru also stated that a turbocharger will not find its way into
                        the BRZ production. Mechanically, the concept car has chassis, suspension and brake upgrades
                        from the Japan-only BRZ tS. Externally, it is distinguished by LED headlights and taillights,
                        new-style alloy wheels and a full bodykit featuring new-design front fascia, rear diffuser and
                        rear wing.</p>

                    <p>The Toyota 86 Shooting Brake Concept was displayed in Sydney, Australia on 6 May 2016[127] and at
                        the Toyota Festival of 86 in Canberra, Australia on 7 May 2016.[128][129] Toyota's global chief
                        engineer Tetsuya Tada saw a quarter scale clay model of the car during a trip to the Australian
                        branch in 2014 and arranged for a full scale, fully function version to be built in Japan by
                        Toyota's Takumi ("artisan") craftsmen.[127] Tada said, “while we never say never, and I would
                        love this concept to become a production reality, it is very much a concept that demonstrates
                        the passion within Toyota for cars that are fun to drive". Commenting on the new car, Toyota's
                        Australian Divisional Manager National Marketing Brad Cramb said: ”The Toyota 86 lends itself
                        perfectly to a concept that expands its appeal with added versatility while retaining its sleek
                        and sporty coupe styling and sharp, responsive driving character”.</p>

                    <p>At the Subaru BRZ's market launch, a 2-part film documented the car's development.[132] In
                        Canada, a TV commercial titled Scorched was shot at Queen and McCaul St. in Toronto.</p>
                    <p>In Australia, Subaru BRZ was the first new car ever to be sold on that market exclusively online,
                        with orders opening on 16 July 2012. It was also marketed with free servicing for 3 years or
                        60,000 km. According to Subaru this sale concept was a success, after the entire 2012 Australian
                        allocation of 201 cars was sold in under 3 hours. The first buyer was able to secure their car
                        in less than 20 minutes from the site going live. This sale process was implemented as a
                        consequence of the demand for the Toyota 86 far outstripping supply (resulting in long delivery
                        times) and a low BRZ supplies for Australia. As of 1 January 2014, the vehicle became available
                        both online and at dealerships, with free servicing no longer included in the purchase.</p>
                    <p>Scion made a similar decision in the United States, creating the 'First 86' program to allow 86
                        buyers to take delivery of their cars before the general public sales. On 12 January 2012 users
                        had eight hours and six minutes to submit their requests to a program website. Winners were
                        required to take their confirmation number and $500 to a dealer within 96 hours to claim their
                        cars.[138] Scion produced a commercial called Close Call featuring Ken Gushi avoiding a
                        collision with a deer while driving Scion FR-S in Mt. Diablo State Park in Northern California.

                <p>The second-generation BRZ debuted on 18 November 2020 and went on sale in the US in late
                    2021.[142][143] The badge-engineered Toyota version was introduced later on 5 April 2021, briefly
                    named the "GR 86".[144] It was later renamed "GR86", without the space, for digital marketing
                    reasons.</p>
                <p>The roof, hood and front fenders are made from aluminium to lower the vehicle's centre of gravity and
                    reduce the weight gain from the engine and safety features.[146] The second-generation BRZ and GR86
                    architecture adopts elements from the Subaru Global Platform (SGP), <b>claiming 50 percent more
                    torsional rigidity than its predecessor.</b></p>

                    <p>Subaru uses the FA24D designation for the new engine. It has a displacement of 2,387 cc (145.7 cu
                        in) using a 94 mm × 86 mm (3.7 in × 3.4 in) bore and stroke, with a power output of 231–235 PS
                        (170–173 kW; 228–232 hp) at 7,000 rpm and a torque output of 250 N⋅m (184 lb⋅ft; 25 kg⋅m) at
                        3,700 rpm.[149] According to Subaru, a naturally aspirated engine was chosen to meet the goal of
                        developing "the ultimate pure sports car". Compared to the previous gen FA20 it retains a
                        free-revving character, with a larger cylinder bore increasing peak torque at a lower rpm.</p>
                    <p>When tested by Car and Driver, the BRZ achieved a 0–97 km/h (0–60 mph) time of 5.4 seconds, with
                        the top speed electronically limited to 225 km/h (140 mph).</p>
                    <p>Vehicles equipped with an automatic transmission and, from 2024, with manual
                        transmissions,[citation needed] include Subaru's advanced driver-assistance system, using
